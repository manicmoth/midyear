## Risks and Issues

<p align="left">
<a style="color:#456990"> We are working on a stand-alone product. There may be more value focusing on plugins for existing products.</a>
    
- Despite the risk, this path provides more freedom for us to prioritize the features our market needs without extra baggage
</p>
<p align="left">
<a style="color:#456990"> The market is fragmented.</a>
    
- We are targeting an underserved segment that currently has few players – none of which are B2C focused
- Risk of other players targeting this same segment
</p>

---

## Summary of Status

- Semester spent better understanding problem space 
- Clear market segment demographic 
- Developed a clear mission driven solution to problem
- Currently have product idea, list of features, wireframe of workflow

---

## Next Steps
- Run our product mockups by users and accordingly adapt
- Build out essential features of our product - 3d viewer, projection mapping
- Integrate with other workflow tooling
